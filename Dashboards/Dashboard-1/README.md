## Portfolio Overview — Business Context

Beyond time and cost efficiency, this dashboard addresses a critical organizational constraint: management attention.
At an early stage of portfolio monitoring, decision-makers need a reliable first-level diagnosis to assess whether the portfolio is broadly healthy or whether specific areas require deeper investigation.

This dashboard was designed as an entry point for credit risk monitoring.
Its purpose is to provide a high-level view of portfolio size, structure, and overall risk,
and to help identify areas where analytical and operational resources should be allocated next.
